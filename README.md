# Step:
1. install libraries
2. load dataset
3. pre-process dataset (label-encoding)
4. train(tokenize on train data, convert to sequences, padding)
5. build model (sequential, embedding, global average pooling 1D, dense)
6. compile and train 
7. use the model (give different piece of text and see what emotions that model give)

# Technique Use:
- Keras
- Tensorflow
